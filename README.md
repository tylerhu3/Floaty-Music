<h2>Mini Audio</h2>
Summary: Simple music app inspired by facebook chatheads. This utilizes a WindowsLayoutManager to make the music head still in focus on top of other apps, a recyclerview to show the music list, and some notification specific things to keep it in focus. Other than that, it's literally a very simple app that just plays music in the background of all other apps.

Features: -Small and Lightweight -Plays in the background of all other apps(Other apps cannot silence it) -Minimizes to background or chatHead -Volume is adjusted independently of device
